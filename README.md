# Automated-Linux-Unix-Command-Manual-Generation
The project aims to automate the generation of a system manual for Linux/Unix commands using shell scripting. The script developed will facilitate the creation of a Text file document structured as a template for each command.
## Specifications

Each command will be presented with its name as the title, followed by a table containing the following information:
- 1.Command Description: The name of the command and information about it.
- 2.Version History of the Command: Extracted using the version command.
- 3.Example: An illustrative example showcasing the usage of the command.
- Related Commands: Extraction of all related commands

This automated approach streamlines the manual generation process, ensuring consistency and efficiency in documenting Linux/Unix commands.<br>
as well as Continuous Improvement and Extension phase is to refine the existing project by introducing additional features and improving usability. This includes the implementation of a command recommendation system that suggests commands based on users' preferences and past usage patterns, enhancing overall user experience. Additionally, a search functionality will be incorporated into the generated manual, enabling users to quickly find information about specific commands or topics, thereby improving the accessibility and usability of the documentation.

## Example
| Description         | Display the current time in the given FORMAT, or set the system date.                                 |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Version             | (GNU coreutils) 8.32                                                                                         |
| Example             | `date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'`                                                                       |
| Related Commands    | update-fonts-scale, Date::Parse, update-dictcommon-hunspell, hp-timedate, fwupdmgr                           |
| Notes               |                                                                                                              |
